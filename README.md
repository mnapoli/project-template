Here is an additional quick introduction, if necessary.

## Why?

Why does this project exist? Come on, don't delete this part. Fill it.
Yes it's hard, but it's perhaps the most important part of the README.

As to why *this* project exist, it's to serve as a template for future open
source PHP projects. Of course, feel free to fork it and make your own recipe.

## Installation

Describe how to install the project/library/framework/…

Make sure your installation instructions work by testing them! If your project use [Composer][1], we suggest to use this:

The recommended way to install MyProject is through [Composer][1]:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "your/project": "@stable"
    }
}
```

__Protip:__ You should browse the [`your/project`][2] page to choose a stable version to use, avoid the `@stable` meta
constraint.

## Usage

Now let's describe how you can use this project!

For the sake of the example, I will include an unnecessarily explicit code block
because the "Usage" section should contain examples.

So here is how you can use this project as a basis for your own future repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mnapoli/project-template.git my-project
$ cd my-project

# Remove the git repository metadata
$ rm -rf .git/

# Start a brand new repository
$ git init
$ git add .
```

Easy peasy! Now you just have to code.

Make sure your examples work by testing them! I didn't test mine and I should feel ashamed.
